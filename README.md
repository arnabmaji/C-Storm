# C-Storm
Welcome to C-Storm.
An open source project for Students by Students.
This is an extensive C Header file created by students of Chitkara University.
From very basics to advance, We have functions of different types used for different purposes.
Our aim is to provide an easy and fun way to program in C, that's all...
You can use this file for your own use and even you can add some other functions that are currently not available in the file.

A FEW POINTS TO LOOK AT:
  1--> Functions can be of any type -for fun or for some real applications... Don't hesitate to add.
  2--> Before adding a function test it out to make sure it's running fine. You can have as many validations as you can.
  3-> When you are adding function write a single line comment mentioning: "Contributed by YOUR_NAME".
  AND DON'T FORGET TO ADD YOUR FUNCTION NAME AND DETAILS IN THE "C-STORM_README" FILE.(MANDATORY BECAUSE IT LET OTHERS KNOW ABOUT YOUR FUNCION WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE CODE).
  4--> Just a request... Don't add duplicate functions.
  5--> If you find any logical holes in a function contributed by someone else, don't hesitate to correct it. You can even mention your name. Like..."Modified by YOUR_NAME".
  6--> Indentation is not compulsory but it is recommended to increase it's readability.
  7--> You can use "//************" to separate one function from another.
  8--> Last but not the least... If you like this project give a thumbs up to it's author ARNAB MAJI (GitHub: arnabmaji19)

  LETS COLLABORATE AND CODE!

  THANK YOU...
