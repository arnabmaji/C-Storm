# C-STORM_README
Welcome to C-Storm, an open source project by Students for Students.

# This file contains behavior of all the functions of the header file and some other references written by their contributors.
# Its gives the user a idea about how a function works, without looking at it's code.
# SPECILA NOTE FOR LINUX USERS: ALWAYS LINK MATH WHILE USING THIS HEADER FILE EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T USE ANY MATH FUNCTIONS,
BECAUSE SOME OF THE INCLUDED FUNCTIONS ARE USING STANDARD MATH FUNCTIONS

#*******************************************************************************#
